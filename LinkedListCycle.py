"""
Detect a cycle in a linked list. Note that the head pointer may be 'None' if the list is empty.

A Node is defined as: 
 
    class Node(object):
        def __init__(self, data = None, next_node = None):
            self.data = data
            self.next = next_node

        head = head.next 
        if head == fast:
            return 1
